TLC5941 is a high-level object-oriented Arduino library for driving large numbers of LEDs using the Texas Instruments TLC5941 and TLC5940 LED drivers. The library is broken into four main classes: The Controller class, which handles all the hardware related stuff, the TLC5941 class, which acts a proxy for each actual TLC5941 (and will be extended to cover TLC5940's shortly), the Light class, which acts as a proxy for each actual string of LEDs attached to the TLC5941's, and the FX class, which is a base class for deriving new effects (e.g., for implementing Cylon/KITT style flashers, or POV renderers).
